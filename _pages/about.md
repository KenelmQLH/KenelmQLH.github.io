I'm a final-year master student from [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes natural language processing, data mining and intelligent education.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/) and Prof. [Zhengya Huang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huangzhy/) of [BDAA Lab](https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/) in School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China.

Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from [Xiamen University(XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2021.
